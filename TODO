TODO

- tools/autogen_docs.lua should include comments for functions (pairing them 
with said functions), and should check for actual functions, not just the word 
"function" followed by a space.
- tools/autogen_loader.lua should somehow insert the name of the library into 
the comments up top. I could maybe rewrite this cleaner with gsub.
- The tools/autogen_*.lua programs could use better command line parsing, and 
some good documentation (thus preferably not generated by autogen_docs ;-)).
- There should be full documentation on how to build ObjL libraries via C or 
C++.
- Some C library helper headers would be nice ;-)
